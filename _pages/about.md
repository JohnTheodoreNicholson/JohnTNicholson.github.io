I am currently a fourth year PhD student at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario. My research supervisor is [Matt Valeriote](https://math.mcmaster.ca/~matt/). I am interested in the connections between universal algebra and theoretical computer science. I also have interests in the formalization of mathematics, specifically in the LEAN Theorem Prover.
